Team name: Woody's Roundup gang !!

Team member: Hitesh Virlani, Aakash Thakkar, Yatharth Grower.

Basically our idea is to create Iceland in which a human(player) can move left, right, down, up. the player has to save himself from the bullet of the gun which will move according to the player for shooting the player.

The difficulty faced while doing project :

This project has total 3 phases : 
    1). Drawing Object.
    2). Movment of Object.
    3). Animation of Object.

    1). Drawing Object :
        This part is not that much difficult because from the lectures we got a good reference for drawing the objects so if we exclude some objects like a shadow, mountain and trees, this face of project goes bit smooth.

    2). Moving of Object : 
        The real difficulty starts from this phase as we have no reference for how to move objects, its difficult to think about it as well as implementation of it.
        
        But somehow after 2 unsuccesful try, we figure out the way to move the objects and then this phase also goes smoothly !!

    3). Animation of Object :
        This is the most tough phase of the project because we have not that much references for it and animation of an individual object is not that much difficult but to sunchronize it with other objects is the most difficult part but after so many unsuccesful try, we finally figure out the way to do it and complete our ptoject !!
